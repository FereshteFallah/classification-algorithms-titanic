**The Titanic dataset** is one of the most famous machine learning datasets used for classification problems.
This dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic ship, which sank in 1912. 
The main objective in this problem is to predict the survival ordeath of passengers based on their characteristics.

### **Dataset Features**  

The Titanic dataset consists of several columns (features) that provide information about the passengers. Some of the most important features are:  

| Column       | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **PassengerId** | Passenger ID |
| **Survived** | Survival (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **Pclass** | Passenger ticket class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class) |
| **Name** | Passenger's name |
| **Sex** | Gender (male = Male, female = Female) |
| **Age** | Passenger's age |
| **SibSp** | Number of siblings or spouses aboard |
| **Parch** | Number of parents or children aboard |
| **Ticket** | Ticket number |
| **Fare** | Ticket fare |
| **Cabin** | Cabin number (most values in this column are missing) |
| **Embarked** | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |



### **Purpose of Using the Titanic Dataset**  

The Titanic dataset is commonly used for machine learning, data analysis, and learning different modeling techniques. The main objectives include:  

✅ **Survival Prediction:** Using passenger features to predict whether an individual survives or not.  

✅ **Data Analysis:** Examining survival patterns based on gender, ticket class, age, etc.  

✅ **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** This dataset contains missing values and textual features that need to be processed.  

✅ **Learning Classification Methods:** Training models such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and more.




### **Conclusion**  

✅ The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known educational datasets for machine learning and data analysis.  
✅ It includes information about Titanic passengers and the target variable **Survived** for predicting survival.  
✅ It can be used for learning classification algorithms, data cleaning, and statistical analysis.
